## Rules:

1. First of all, we'll random a number between 1 and 20 I call it ***target number***, and player have to guess that number.
2. Let player input a number into the guess input field

3. When player press 'Check' button or hit 'Enter' key, the game will check whether the inputed value is equal to ***target number***. 
    - If correct, we'll change the message on right side of screen to something like "Congratulation ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰", change the "?" to the ***target number***. And set the current score and high score (the inital high score is 20). Also change the background to green color.

    - If incorrect, check if current score is greater than 0, decrease the score by 1. Also update the message: If the ***target number*** higher the the guessed number, the message should be "Too low", otherwise "Too high".

    - If incorrect and the current score is 0, expose the ***target number***, change the message to something like "You lost the game ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢", also change the background color.
