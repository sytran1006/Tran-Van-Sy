# Coding Challenge

Write a program that receives a list of variable names written in underscore_case and convert them to camelCase.
The input will come from a textarea inserted into the DOM (see code below to insert the elements), and conversion will happen when the button is pressed.

***Test data***
underscore_case
my_first_name
Some_Variable
calculate_AGE
delayed_departure

***Should produce this output (5 separate console.log outputs):***

    myFirstName         ✅✅
    someVariable        ✅✅✅
    calculateAge        ✅✅✅✅
    delayedDeparture    ✅✅✅✅✅
